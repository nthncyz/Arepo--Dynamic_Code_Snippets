# Arepo: Dynamic_Code_Snippets

Arepo is a collection of practical code snippets crafted from real-world experience. This repository offers Java and C++ examples that solve everyday programming challenges—everything from triggering a game’s magic shield at the right moment to issuing weather advisories, monitoring noise levels, and calculating bonus points.

Each snippet is designed to be easy to integrate into your projects, whether you're working on gameplay mechanics or responsive systems. Detailed comments and usage examples make the integration process seamless.

This repository contains several code snippets demonstrating conditional logic and basic programming concepts, suitable for incorporation into larger projects.

## Snippets Included

### 1. `bonus_points_calculator.java`

* **Description:** Calculates bonus points in a game based on player level, levels cleared, and whether special levels (Boss/Puzzle) were completed. Uses nested `if/else` statements.
* **Usage:** For gaming applications needing dynamic bonus point calculations based on player performance.
* **Example Use Case:** A mobile RPG where players earn bonus rewards for completing quests and dungeons.

### 2. `noise_monitoring.cpp`

* **Description:** Monitors ambient noise levels (in decibels) and checks if the level exceeds a threshold (85 dB), signaling potential noise pollution.
* **Usage:** Ideal for environmental monitoring, smart city projects, or noise-sensitive spaces.
* **Example Use Case:** A smartphone app measuring noise levels to alert users about harmful noise exposure.
* **Note:** Requires `#include <iostream>`

### 3. `weather_advisory.cpp`

* **Description:** Issues a weather advisory if the temperature is at or below freezing (0°C), warning of potential ice on the roads.
* **Usage:** Suitable for weather stations, traffic systems, or apps needing weather-related safety alerts.
* **Example Use Case:** An automated weather alert system notifying drivers about icy road conditions.
* **Note:** Requires `#include <iostream>`

### 4. `shield_activation.java`

* **Description:** Simulates the activation of a magic shield in a video game based on a character's mana level. If mana is sufficient (>= 50), the shield activates.
* **Usage:** Implements dynamic defense systems in game development based on character attributes or resource levels.
* **Example Use Case:** A fantasy RPG where players activate a magic shield when their mana is high enough, boosting defense.

### 5. `fitness_activity_tracker.cpp` (New)

* **Description:** A fitness tracker that estimates calories burned during jogging, cycling, or swimming based on user input for time spent in each activity.
* **Usage:** Ideal for fitness apps or health-related projects to track physical activity and energy expenditure.
* **Example Use Case:** A mobile health app that calculates calories burned based on daily exercise activities.

This repository contains several code snippets demonstrating conditional logic and basic programming concepts. Each snippet is designed to be easily integrated into larger projects.

## Snippets Included

### 1. `bonus_points_calculator.java`

*   **Description:** This Java program calculates bonus points in a game based on player level, levels cleared, and whether specific types of levels (Boss Level or Puzzle Level) were cleared.  It uses nested `if/else` statements to implement the game's reward logic.
*   **Usage:** This snippet is intended for integration into a gaming application's reward system. It can be used to dynamically calculate bonus points for players based on their in-game performance, encouraging engagement and progression.
*   **Example Use Case:**  A mobile RPG where players earn bonus rewards for completing daily quests and challenging dungeons.

### 2. `noise_monitoring.cpp`

*   **Description:** This C++ program simulates a noise monitoring system. It takes a noise level in decibels (dB) as input and determines whether the level exceeds a predefined threshold (85 dB), indicating potential noise pollution.
*   **Usage:** This snippet can be used in environmental monitoring applications, smart city projects, or noise-sensitive environments.  It provides a simple way to detect and alert users to potentially harmful noise levels.
*   **Example Use Case:**  A smartphone app that measures ambient noise levels and warns the user if they are in a potentially damaging environment (e.g., a loud concert).  Alternatively, it could be integrated into a sensor system in a library or hospital to ensure a quiet environment.
*    **Note:** Requires `#include <iostream>`

### 3. `weather_advisory.cpp`

*   **Description:** This C++ program determines whether to issue a weather advisory based on the current temperature. If the temperature is at or below freezing (0°C), it issues a warning about potential ice on the roads.
*   **Usage:** This snippet is suitable for weather stations, traffic management systems, or applications that need to provide weather-related safety alerts.
*   **Example Use Case:** An automated weather alert system that sends out text messages or notifications to drivers when icy road conditions are likely. Can be combined with real-time sensor data for more accurate alerts.
*    **Note:** Requires `#include <iostream>`

### 4. `shield_activation.java`

*   **Description:** This Java program simulates the activation of a magic shield in a video game based on the character's mana level.  If the mana level is sufficient (>= 50), the shield activates, providing enhanced defense.  Otherwise, the character relies on basic defense.
*   **Usage:** This snippet can be used in game development to implement dynamic defense mechanisms based on character attributes or resource availability.
*   **Example Use Case:** A fantasy RPG where the player's magic shield can be activated when they have enough mana, offering a temporary boost to their defense against enemy attacks.
